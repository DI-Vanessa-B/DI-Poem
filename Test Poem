Snow, so much snow
I guess this is what winter is about
in the forest I search for a doe
but there is no doubt

that the doe has been shot
by a hunter with a bow
red snow, feeling hot
treading, breaking a bough

my head shoots up
in the dark I see a man
I must escape, I've got a plan
but then I notice a pup

a small wolf with a broken leg
I can't leave him, his eyes beg
for mercy, I've got no choice
I take him in, shh keep down your voice
